- Decided to use GitHub for collaboration and version control.
- Determined team roles and set up GitHub for version control and collaboration.

### 2️⃣ **Analysis**
- Studied the needs of a typical car dealership website (inventory, contact form, branding).
- Created a feature list (homepage, about, contact, inventory).
- Defined user interactions and responsive behavior.


### 3️⃣ **Design**
- Designed the UI layout using simple mockups.
- Chose a consistent color palette and typography.
- Designed responsive structure for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Ensured accessibility and UI/UX compliance.

### 4️⃣ **Implementation (Coding)**
